[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

An example template made using [Next.js and Typescript](https://nextjs.org/docs) to start a new project. The template is setup with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started), [StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/get-started) and [Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).

This template use next.js version 12.3.1. Read more about [release](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v12.3.1)

## Why this template

I made this template because I have to set up every time Prettier, ESLint, StyleLint and Lint Staged for my new next.js projects. And I thought this might be useful for developers who are looking for configuration or starter or example templates.
